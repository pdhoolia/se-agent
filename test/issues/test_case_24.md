At the moment we only consider code files (e.g., `.py`) for formulating semantic understanding, localizing issues, and suggesting changes. We should cover all the files:

- documents, configurations, deployments scripts, notebooks, etc. may offer valuable information to understand the context of issues and suggest changes
- to fix and issue changes may be required in configurations, documentation, and other files
