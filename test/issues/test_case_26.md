Our software engineering agent listens to GitHub events such as issue creation, issue comments. It processes those events to localize their impact to existing files in the repository, and then suggest changes to address the issues or comments. Agent server offers additional APIs to onboard to a repository. Onboarding processing allows it clone the repository and for each file generate a semantic summary that it may use in later processing. An additional API is related to processing git push events, where the agent incrementally processes the files modified as a part of the push in a similar manner. The onboarding, and push event handling APIs are synchronous at the moment. Depending on the size of the repository, or the size of push, the processing of these APIs could far exceed the timeouts associated with synchronous APIs, leading to errors. At the moment a check-pointing features serves as a work-around for the timeout issue. Checkpoint saves information on all the files that have been processed during onboarding, or incremental update. It is deleted if the processing finishes without any issues. In case of timeout issues, it is used by a subsequent onboarding call, to skip previously processed files. In addition the timeout has been increased as well.

Suggestions are invited on design patterns that may help solve this issue. One pattern I had in mind was to make these 2 APIs asynchronous. Return with a `task_id` and `in_progress` status, and introduce GET method to fetching updated status for the task (for clients that want to poll), as well as support callbacks to push updated status on task completion (successful or erroneous).
