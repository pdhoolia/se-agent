Localizer, and change suggester components use `top_n_packages` and `top_n_files` global configurations to keep the data the LLM uses in line with the maximum supported inline context size by the model.

We should be able to govern these configurations as the level of project. A large and complex repo may have large packages. Hence the detailed semantic understanding per package may be large. Consequently, it may want to keep the top_n_packages to be used for localizing the issue to specific code files as small. Similarly a project may want to add a smaller number of files for change suggestions depending on size of the files and the model's capacity to handle them.
