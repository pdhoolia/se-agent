At the moment, the agent uses its own api keys for LLM use. This is OK for demonstration purposes. However, for production, we need to have the projects bring in their own keys. They should be able to onboard using their keys. Since the agent supports multiple LLM providers, the project should be able to supply api-keys for multiple providers and even configure their own provider of choice. Project owners should be able to change their keys, or their llm provider of choice at any time.

At related side effect would also be on the ay model configurations are handled. At the moment, they are loading one time while loading the LLM api interface. Further, they are project agnostic. This would need to change. The model configurations may need to be loaded per project and allow for a change depending on the change in project's configurations.

Another related side effect may be on how the changes to a project are conveyed. ATM, `PUT /onboard` is the only way to communicate a change in the project configuration. However, it is implemented to re-onboard the whole project. This may be an overkill if only the api keys are refreshed. We may need new endpoints to handle such changes.
