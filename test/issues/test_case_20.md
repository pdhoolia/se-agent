Lack of domain understanding may sometime lead to suggestions that are not feasible or practical. For example, suggesting a change in an emulator (that is supposed to exactly replicate quantum hardware) may not be the right suggestion to fix a bug in qiskit. Or something that is not possible in the current version of the programming language, or suggesting a change that is not in line with the project's coding standards.

When agent makes such proposals, other developers may point out the issues with the suggestion via comments. The agent should be able to understand these comments and their context and learn from them. It should be able to create a succinct, condensed memory of this understanding and store it for future reference.

Here's a high-level plan to implement this feature:

- Before starting to process an issue comment, the agent may analyze the comment to check if it represents a domain understanding correction. This may be done by checking if the comment may be semantically categorized as a domain characteristic. Note: The agent probably uses the term `project` (for domain).

- If comment is identified as a domain understanding correction, the agent should add new functionality to generate a condensed memory of this understanding.
    - It should use the issue conversation context to generate this memory.
    - It should add a new LLM task for this purpose, form a prompt, and call the LLM to generate memories (there could be more than 1). Each memory should be condensed (e.g., no more than 20 tokens)
    - Agent should store these memories in a memory store. For the first version, we can use a json file in the metadata folder for storing memories.
    - Each memory should be stored as a json object with the following fields:
        - `memory_id`: An id (generated) for the memory
        - `issue_id`: The issue id in the context of which this memory was generated
        - `comment_id`: The comment id based on which this memory was generated
        - `memory`: The memory text
        - `user_id`: The user id who made the comment
        - `created_at`: The timestamp when this memory was created
        - `updated_at`: The timestamp when this memory was last updated
        - `status`: At the time of creation, the status of the memory should be `new`. This status may be updated later based on curation by an expert. Expert may mark it as `accepted`, `rejected`, `needs_review` etc.

- The agent should retrieve these memories when processing new issues or comments. In particular, it should use them in the prompts for localization and suggestions.
