We use large language models to generate a semantic summary in a specific markdown format for a code file, or a higher order summary at the level of packages. Some of the models tend to add some prefix and suffix to the markdown in their. E.g.,
- Here's what i have done ...
- Let me know if this is what you wanted ...

Let's go with a structured output parsing approach similar to what is used in the `localizer.py`, and put together the markdown file in the calling function `update_codebase_understanding` before we store in the metadata.
